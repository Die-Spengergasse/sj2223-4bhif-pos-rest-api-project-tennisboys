# Colorscheme

## Introduction

Why do we need a colorscheme? The answer is simple: so that we can have a consistent look and feel across all of our routes. This is important because it helps us to create a more cohesive experience for our users. It also helps us to create a more consistent experience for our developers.

## Why did we choose this colorscheme?

We always liked the color blue and we used related colorscheme in previous projects. We also wanted to use a colorscheme that was easy to read and that would be easy to use for people with color blindness.
Next, we wanted the colorscheme to collaborate with the topic of our project. Meaning it had to be related to tennis. In tennis there are various colors from blue to green to red. We decided to fit the theme of the professional blue courts.

## How do I use this colorscheme?

You simply use the tailwind class names that are listed below. You can also use the tailwind class names in your own css files. We implemented our custom colorscheme in the tailwind.config.js file. You can find the file in the root of the project.
